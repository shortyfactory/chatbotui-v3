## Local Quickstart

Follow these steps to get your own Chatbot UI instance running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shortyfactory/chatbotui-v2.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the root directory of your local Chatbot UI repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Install Supabase & Run Locally

#### Why Supabase?

Previously, we used local browser storage to store data. However, this was not a good solution for a few reasons:

- Security issues
- Limited storage
- Limits multi-modal use cases

#### 1. Install Docker

You will need to install Docker to run Supabase locally. You can download it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) for free.

#### 2. Install Supabase CLI

**MacOS/Linux**

```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

**Windows**

```bash
scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install supabase
```

#### 3. Start Supabase

In your terminal at the root of your local Chatbot UI repository, run:

```bash
supabase start
```

### 4. Fill in Secrets

#### 1. Environment Variables

In your terminal at the root of your local Chatbot UI repository, run:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Get the required values by running:

```bash
supabase status
```

Note: Use `API URL` from `supabase status` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
Note: Use `anon key` from `supabase status` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
Note: Use `service_role key` from `supabase status` for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

Now go to your `.env.local` file and fill in the values.

If the environment variable is set, it will disable the input in the user settings.

#### 2. SQL Setup

In the 1st migration file `supabase/migrations/20240108234540_setup.sql` you will need to replace 2 values with the values you got above:

- `project_url` (line 53): `http://supabase_kong_chatbotui:8000` (default) can remain unchanged if you don't change your `project_id` in the `config.toml` file
- `service_role_key` (line 54): You got this value from running `supabase status`

This prevents issues with storage files not being deleted properly.

### 6. Run app locally

In your terminal at the root of your local Chatbot UI repository, run:

```bash
npm run chat
```

Your local instance of Chatbot UI should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Be sure to use a compatible node version (i.e. v18).

You can view your backend GUI at [http://localhost:54323/project/default/editor](http://localhost:54323/project/default/editor).

## Hosted Supabase Quickstart

Follow these steps to get your own Chatbot UI instance running in the cloud.

### 1. Follow Local Quickstart

Repeat steps 1-3 in "Local Quickstart" above.

### 2. Setup Backend with Supabase

#### 1. Create a new project

Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.

#### 2. Get Project Values

Once you are in the project dashboard, click on the "Project Settings" icon tab on the far bottom left.

Here you will get the values for the following environment variables:

- `Project Ref`: Found in "General settings" as "Reference ID"

- `Project ID`: Found in the URL of your project dashboard (Ex: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/settings/general)

While still in "Settings" click on the "API" text tab on the left.

Here you will get the values for the following environment variables:

- `Project URL`: Found in "API Settings" as "Project URL"

- `Anon key`: Found in "Project API keys" as "anon public"

- `Service role key`: Found in "Project API keys" as "service_role" (Reminder: Treat this like a password!)

#### 3. Configure Auth

Next, click on the "Authentication" icon tab on the far left.

In the text tabs, click on "Providers" and make sure "Email" is enabled.

#### 4. Environment Variables

In your terminal at the root of your Chatbot UI repository, run:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now go to your `.env.local` file and fill in the values.

If the environment variable is set, it will disable the input in the user settings.


#### 5. Connect to Hosted DB

Open up your repository for your hosted instance of Chatbot UI.

In the 1st migration file `supabase/migrations/20240108234540_setup.sql` you will need to replace 2 values with the values you got above:

- `project_url` (line 53): Use the `Project URL` value from above
- `service_role_key` (line 54): Use the `Service role key` value from above

Now, open a terminal in the root directory of your Chatbot UI repository. We will execute a few commands here.

Login to Supabase by running:

```bash
supabase login
```

Next, link your project by running the following command with the "Project ID" you got above:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
```

Your project should now be linked.

Finally, push your database to Supabase by running:

```bash
supabase db push
```

Your hosted database should now be set up!

#### 6. Run App in Docker

In your terminal at the root of your local Chatbot UI repository, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Your instance of Chatbot UI should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How to move from Hosted Supabase to Local Supabase

- `service_role_key` (line 54): You got this value from running `supabase status` - (`service_role key`)

This prevents issues with storage files not being deleted properly.

#### 3. Environment Variables
Now go to your `.env.local` file and change the values with values that you got from running `supabase status`.

Note: 
- Use `API URL` from `supabase status` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- Use `anon key` from `supabase status` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

  SMTP_HOST=supabase-mail
  SMTP_PORT=2500
  SMTP_USER=fake_mail_user
  SMTP_PASS=fake_mail_password
  SMTP_SENDER_NAME=fake_sender
```

After this start supabase with docker

```bash
# Pull the latest images
docker compose pull

# Start the services (in detached mode)
docker compose up -d
```

## Install ChatbotUI

Clone repository to the root folder

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shortyfactoryGOPA/chatbotui-v2.2.git
```

Then create `.env.local` file from example file and fill with your data:

```bash
  # Copy the example env vars
  cp .env.example .env.local
```

```bash
# Change `127.0.0.1` with your Server IP
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:80 
# Your ANON_KEY from step when you run self-hosted supabase
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
# Your SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from step when you run self-hosted supabase
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# OpenAI APi Key
  OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Azure OpenAI APi Key  
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
# Azure OpenAI Endpoint  
  AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
# Azure gpt-4-turbo model deployment name
  AZURE_GPT_45_TURBO_NAME=

  AZURE_GPT_45_O_NAME=
# Azure text-embedding-ada-002 or text-embedding-3-small model deployment name (Needs if you will use file uploads)
  AZURE_EMBEDDINGS_NAME=
```

Now run DB Supabase migrations:

```bash
# Replace `<your_tenant_id>` with the tenant id from the step when you setup Self-Hosted Supabase (.env file) `POOLER_TENANT_ID`
# Replace `<password>` with the password from the step when you setup Self-Hosted Supabase (.env file) `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
# Replace `<server_ip_address>` with your server IP address
  supabase db reset --db-url "postgres://postgres.<your_tenant_id>:<password>@<server_ip_address>:5432/postgres"
```

If you pulled new version then apply new migrations with command:

```bash
# Replace `<your_tenant_id>` with the tenant id from the step when you setup Self-Hosted Supabase (.env file) `POOLER_TENANT_ID`
# Replace `<password>` with the password from the step when you setup Self-Hosted Supabase (.env file) `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
# Replace `<server_ip_address>` with your server IP address
  supabase db push --db-url "postgres://postgres.<your_tenant_id>:<password>@<server_ip_address>:5432/postgres"
```

Now start Application

```bash
  docker compose up -d
```

Application will be started on port `3000`

Supabase Dashboard will be started on port `80`
