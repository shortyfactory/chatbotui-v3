-- Migration for automated file cleanup using pg_cron in self-hosted Supabase

--------------- Enable Extensions ---------------

-- Enable the pg_cron extension for scheduling
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;

-- Enable the uuid-ossp extension if UUIDs are used but not yet enabled
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

--------------- FUNCTIONS ---------------

-- Use the existing delete_storage_object_from_bucket function to avoid redundancy
-- Reuses delete_storage_object function for HTTP-based deletion as defined previously.

-- Function to delete files older than 30 days, along with related data
